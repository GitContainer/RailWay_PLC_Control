# RailWay_PLC_Control
##### This project will create a 2 trains HMI system for the user to simulation different railway operation. The system use Schneider M221 and siemens s7 1200 to control the hardware. The program can also simulate 3 kind of cyber attack for the railway system.

###### Function Tab Introduction

| The program provide 2 function tab to display system operation information and let user control/simulation different function |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tab Idx0 System: Control the different components in the rail way system and 2 trains. |
| Tab Idx1 PLC Control:  Show the PLC information and user can turn on/off PLC coils from this tab. |
| Tab Idx2 Data Display: Show the PLC Memory /register status or overwrite PLC data. |
| Tab Setting: Change the system setting and start different cyber attack simulation. |
